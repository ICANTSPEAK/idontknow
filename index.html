      <p class="text-muted" >On April of 2021, I had visited HersheyPark for the first time. My first rides there were pretty simple and didn't give me any headaches and I wasn't scared. Then, I waited in line for at least two hours for the next ride. It was very boring to wait so I played some games on my dad's phone. When I was on the ride, it was going really fast and I thought I would crash into something. It made me pretty dizzy and I needed a break from the ride. A few minutes after that ride, I went to a ship ride with my dad and mom. This time, my mom was the one who was dizzy because she isn't used to these kind of rides. We had dinner later and then we went to our hotel to take a shower, brush our teeth, and go to sleep. The next day, I went to ChocolateWorld with my parents. This time, there were not any rides, but there was a lot of chocolate! It is technically part of HersheyPark though. The first event was chocolate experiments. I forgot what they were, but at the end, I had some extra chocolate and also a big Hershey's bar on the bottom! Next was the 3D movie. We got 3D glasses that we got to keep and we were supposed to wear them while watching the movie. The 3D movie was epic, and the characters looked like they were actually right next to us! After those two events, I had lunch because the events took quite a while. The only thing left I remembered was the last event of the day, making our own chocolate! I made a dark chocolate with pretty much all the ingredients. My mom did the same but just without the sprinkles. My dad also did a similar one to mine but with milk chocolate instead. I stayed at the hotel for one more night after that, and then it was time to leave the next morning after breakfast! My first experience at HersheyPark was amazing!</p>
